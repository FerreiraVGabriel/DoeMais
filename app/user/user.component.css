In NativeScript, the app.css file is where you place CSS rules that
you would like to apply to your entire application. Check out
http://docs.nativescript.org/ui/styling for a full list of the CSS
selectors and properties you can use to style UI components.

/*
For example, the following CSS rule changes the font size of all UI
components that have the btn class name.
*/
.btn {
    font-size: 18;
}

.skeleton-light {
    background-color: #46556E;
}

.skeleton-dark {
    background-color: #ffffff;
}

.skeleton-accent {
    background-color: #ffffff;
}

ListView {
    background-color: transparent;
    separator-color: transparent;
}

/*
In many cases you may want to use the NativeScript core theme instead
of writing your own CSS rules. For a full list of class names in the theme
refer to http://docs.nativescript.org/ui/theme.
